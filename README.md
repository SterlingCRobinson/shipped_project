##Technology Used

•BACKEND 
	-Ruby on Rails -Sqlite3

•FRONTEND 
	-HTML -CSS -JavaScript -CoffeeScript

##HOW IT WORKS


• The backend is all "Ruby on Rails" using SQlite3 for the database engine and uses Activerecord for the Database Object Relational Mapping or (ORM).


• The frontend uses HTML for render tags and routing for each page and uses CSS for the basic coloring, fonts and styling. The JavaScript is used for the functionality behind dropping off containers on ships.


• This app allows a user to signup and create jobs and or list boats for those jobs for shipping logistics.
